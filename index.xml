      <description>This recipe is based (heavily) upon one from none-other than the Doc himself - Greg Doucette. Mike and I have tweaked it slightly (mostly Mike - but he probably won&amp;rsquo;t read this so I&amp;rsquo;ll take the credit). This is definitely a good one if you&amp;rsquo;re planning on eating a lot of protein bars year-round!
It is on the pricey side the first time you order all of the ingredients, but if you&amp;rsquo;re planning on making them they pay for themselves.</description>

      <description>A quick test of my very first post! Here is the body of your post. Everything you write here will display as a paragraph. Just because text in on a new line here, does NOT mean that it will be on a new line on your webpage.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like a new line on your page - you have to hit ENTER twice and have a blank line between the bodies of text!</description>
