Mike and I love eating protein bars after a work-out, or as a mid-day snack to keep us satisfied until our next meal. While there are so many delicious protein bars out there (I am talking to you Quest Birthday Cake), they are not always budget friendly when you plan on eating them several times a week.</description>
