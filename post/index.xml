      <description>This recipe is based (heavily) upon one from none-other than the Doc himself - Greg Doucette. Mike and I have tweaked it slightly (mostly Mike - but he probably won&amp;rsquo;t read this so I&amp;rsquo;ll take the credit). This is definitely a good one if you&amp;rsquo;re planning on eating a lot of protein bars year-round!
It is on the pricey side the first time you order all of the ingredients, but if you&amp;rsquo;re planning on making them they pay for themselves.</description>
